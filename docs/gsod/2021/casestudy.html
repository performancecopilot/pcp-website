<h3>About Performance Co-Pilot</h3>
<p>
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open-source distributed
system performance analysis toolkit.
It efficiently collects metrics from multiple systems and
provides a variety of web, graphical and console tools for
analysis of live and historical data.
</p>
<p>
The suite begun production use over 20 years ago primarily
in the High Performance Computing arena, however its
customizable and lightweight design has proven popular on
everything from tiny system-on-a-chip machines through to
vast databases and number-crunching super computers.
It is included in all Linux distributions and has an active
base of users and developers.

<h3>About Task-based Guides</h3>
<p>
In our
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2020/ideas.html#readthedocs-pcp'>previous</a>
Google Season of Docs project, we converted
two freely-available books (the "Users and Administrators Guide"
and the "Programmers Guide"), the REST API documentation, and
other content into
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>pcp.readthedocs.io .</a>
</p>
<p>
It is this
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2021/proposal.html'>latest</a>
project we tackled the curation of a new, consistent series of
focussed, task-oriented "How To" guides that assist new users
in engaging immediately, by clearly showing how to solve small
specific problem scenarios users encounter frequently.
</p>
</div>
<div class='features_title row'>
<h3>Proposal Abstract</h3>
<p>
The primary goal of this
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2021/proposal.html'>project</a>
was to assist first-time users to become more productive right away,
while also directing traffic toward the more detailed books in
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>close proximity</a>
to the new guides.
</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<div class='row'>
<section class='row__colspaced'>
<h4>Creating the proposal</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
Initial work creating a proposal was done by the team in
collaboration with Arzoo, based on guides we had in the
form of email exchanges, known areas of need, as well as
pre-existing guides in different formats from the main
PCP website.
</p>
<p>
Once all involved agreed on the initial project content,
we moved into establishing the project budget plan.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Budget</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
We primarily based our initial budget on funding our
writer, based on previous years activities and the
recommended reasonable ranges of funding from Google.
</p>
<p>
One unexpected area of difficulty was interacting with
financing and shipping companies in India.
After a relatively trouble-free initial payment to our
writer early on, the environment around OpenCollective
seemed to change for payments in India and we continue
to work with them to ensure subsequent payments arrive.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we budgeted for some swag, but trouble with
shipments into India by our provider company
<a href='https://www.redbubble.com/i/hat/Performance-Co-Pilot-classic-logo-by-pcp-maintainers/89364453.FACOX'>Red Bubble</a>
meant some contributors ended up unable to receive the
swag.
As a result, they kindly donated their funding to the
PCP project for other uses, with a plan for anyone who
travels internationally for a meetup in-person to bring
in swag for them, in the future when possible.
</p>
<p>
Other than these problems, the budget overall was quite
appropriate and worked out well.

<p>
Several experienced community members volunteered to assist -
PCP maintainers, developer and a documentation specialist.
Our wonderful writer Arzoo from last years Google Season of
Docs program agreed to work with us once more.
</p>
<p>
With contributors spanning only APAC countries (Australia,
Japan and India), we found we were able to communicate well
once more, with quick responses being in similar timezones.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
Arzoo maintained an excellent
<a href='https://github.com/arzoo14/Google-Season-of-Docs-2021/blob/main/timeline_deliverables.md'>timeline of deliverable items</a>
and the status of each item, throughout the project.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Results</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
As observed in the time line we completed the bulk of
the work we set out to achieve.
The landing page for Performance Co-Pilot
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QG/QuickGuides.html'>Quick Guides</a>
is now available and features prominently in the PCP
documentation.
</p>
<p>
There were a couple of disruptions during the length
of the project - laptop hardware failure and a short
period of recuperation after illness.
However, Arzoo was able to recover from these setbacks
to complete most of the planned work - mainly we did
not get into the stretch goals of the video tutorials
and animated console examples).
</p>
</div>
<h4>Measuring Success</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
We anticipated the new guides would provide a better
suited entry point for new and inexperienced users.
</p>
<p>
Arzoo enabled
<a href='https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/google-analytics.html'>Google analytics</a>
early on in the project.
Since there were very few guides to start with, and with
disrupted progress in the middle of the project, this is
a summary of our observed traffic statistics at the end:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>46% of views (out of 1040) involved the Quick Guides</li>
<li>37% of users (out of 244) opened the Quick Guides</li>
<li>6% (out of 223) were new users</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
The project was certainly overall a success.
</p>
<p>
Going forward we need to keep an eye on the web analytics
to ensure the guides are serving their purpose, as well as
to help identify other possible areas needing short guides.
</p>
<p>
As we didn't complete any video or animated style tutorials
we were unable to use that metric as originally planned (in
order to assess if such mediums are preferred by users and
whether they provde more popular than text and diagrams).
</p>

<div class='features_title row'>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
A good result for the Performance Co-Pilot project.
We have a baseline set of short guides getting new users
of the software able to solve problems immediately, and
to learn more quickly about the wider set of PCP tools.
</p>
<p>
We introduced consistency into all Tutorials and Guides
across the project, by using a single readthedocs.io
landing page for all PCP guides (same location, format,
look-and-feel).
Each new guide we add now will be incorporated into the
set we've established during this project.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what we'd do differently next time, perhaps
a focus on getting video tutorials and animated console
examples integrated earlier on would have helped us to
get content suited to that medium using it more, instead
of running out of time to explore that at the end.
</p>
<p>
We've really enjoyed working with Arzoo further improving
the PCP documentation - a big thanks again to Google for
running this program!
