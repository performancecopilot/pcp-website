<h3>About Performance Co-Pilot</h3>
<p>
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open-source distributed
system performance analysis toolkit.
It efficiently collects metrics from multiple systems and
provides a variety of web, graphical and console tools for
analysis of live and historical data.
</p>
<p>
The suite begun production use over 20 years ago primarily
in the High Performance Computing arena, however its
customizable and lightweight design has proven popular on
everything from tiny system-on-a-chip machines through to
vast databases and number-crunching super computers.
It is included in all Linux distributions and has an active
base of users and developers.

<h3>About Task-based Guides</h3>
</div>
<div class='row'>
<p>
In our previous Google Season of Docs project, we converted
two freely-available books (the "Users and Administrators Guide"
and the "Programmers Guide") into
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>pcp.readthedocs.io</a>
content.
We also extended this documentation with a new REST API guide,
and made many other improvements.
</p>
<p>
However, due to the many available tools, daemons, integrations
and APIs we still find a high barrier to entry for new PCP
users.
</p>
<p>
It is this we plan to tackle next with our writer - curating a
new series of focussed, task-oriented "How To" guides that will
assist new users in engaging immediately, by clearly showing
how to solve specific problem scenarios that users encounter
frequently.
</p>
<p>
The goals of the project are this to assist first-time users to
become more productive right away, while also increasing traffic
to the more detailed books in the same location (readthedocs.io).
We plan to undertake this project over three months.
</p>
<br>
<h4>The Task-based Guides project will:</h4>
<p>
Pair developers with the writer to produce succinct step-by-step
recipes showing how to perform certain tasks with PCP.
</p>
<p>
Task-based topics include:
<div class='row'>
<div class='colspan12-12 colspan8-8 colspan6-6 colspan2-2 as-grid with-gutter'>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
<strong>How do I ...</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>List the available performance metrics?</li>
<li>Add new metrics to the available set?</li>
<li>Record metrics on my local system?</li>
<li>Record metrics from a remote system?</li>
<li>Graph a performance metric?</li>
<li>Automate performance problem detection?</li>
<li>Setup automated rules to write to the system log?</li>
<li>
Record historical values for use with the
<a href='https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pcp-dstat.1.html'>pcp-dstat</a>
tool?
</li>
<li>Export metric values in a comma-separated format?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the writer will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Canvas the community for additional topics beyond the
set above to produce an initial set of high-value guides
</li>
<li>
Provide feedback to developers about potential areas of
improvements in the tools to create more satisfying early
user experiences.
</li>
<li>
Audit existing documentation for tutorial content to add
into the new
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>readthedocs</a>
guide format.
This involves an assessment of the existing
<a href='https://pcp.io/documentation.html'>Short Guides</a>
and refactoring these into the
<strong>"How do I..."</strong>
form.
</li>
<li>
Introduce consistency into all Tutorials and Guides
across the project, by using a single readthedocs.io
landing page for all guides (same location, format,
look-and-feel).
</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Work that is out-of-scope for this project:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This project will focus on core PCP functionality,
and not on integration with (for example) 3rd party
sources of metrics, or sending PCP metrics to other
analysis systems.

<p>
We have a strong technical writing candidate for the
project who was our writer from Google Season of Docs
last year and is interested in working on another major
project.
We have a proven, successful relationship that we are
keen to continue to build on.
</p>
<p>
This project expands on the readthedocs documentation that
was produced last year, so we anticipate rapid results as
our writer is already very familiar with PCP and Grafana.
</p>
<p>
Three volunteers have come forward to assist Arzoo again - a
PCP maintainer, a developer and a documentation specialist -
all of whom volunteered last year as well.

<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
<p>
We anticipate the How To pages will provide a better suited
entry point for both new and some existing users.
We will measure this by first enabling
<a href='https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/google-analytics.html'>Google analytics</a>
on our readthedocs pages to begin tracking page accesses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Success will be indicated by:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The largest number of hits to documentation pages being to the
new Task-based Guides pages (we expect greater than double any
other books as a measure of success).
This success measure will be presented as a graph showing the
spread of hits, with the most being attributed to the new
Task-based Guides.
</li>
<li>
A correlated increase in the number of hits to the existing
PCP documentation - the
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/UAG/AboutUAGGuide.html'>Users Guide ,</a>
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/PG/AboutPGGuide.html'>Programmers Guide</a>
and
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/'>REST API Guide</a>
as a result of the new (shorter, focussed) guides.
We aim for a 20% increase in access to the other Guides as our
success measure.
</li>
<li>
Some guides will be in different forms - video-based vs text -
we'll also use the analytics to determine which formats are
more successful than others.
This will be presented as a graph also; simply having this
breakdown will indicate success to us, we can use that
information to decide future documentation styles to prefer.

<h3>Other notes</h3>
<p>
PCP is a mature open source project, active now for
well over 20 years.
We have experience mentoring students and writers,
participating in Google Summer of Code for 5 years,
and in last years Google Season of Docs program.
We had a very successfully collaboration with our
writer last year which we'd love to build on further
this year.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for running the Season of Docs program.
Our users have benefitted immensely from it and it
has allowed us to move in directions our resources
would not have allowed so we're extremely grateful!
