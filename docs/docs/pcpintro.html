<P>The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open source toolkit designed for monitoring and managing system-level performance.  These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate the most complex system configurations and performance problems.
<P>PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Solaris and Windows (Win32).  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:
<UL> <LI><I>PCP Collectors</I>.  These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the kernel or a database.  These are available from <A HREF="https://pcp.io/">https://pcp.io/</A>.
<P> <LI><I>PCP Monitors</I>.  These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of PCP.  Other monitoring tools are available separately, such as pmchart, in layered packages that build on the core PCP functionality.
</UL>
<P>This document describes the high-level features and options common to most PCP utilities available on all platforms.

</TABLE>
<P>The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being  monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (<B>pmcd</B>(1)) on the same host.
<P>Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to <B>pmcd</B>(1), which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive (created using <B>pmlogger</B>(1)) for retrospective analysis.
<P>Each tool or command is documented completely in its own reference page.
<P>The following performance monitoring applications are primarily console based, are typically run directly from the command line, and are all part of the base PCP package.
<UL><LI><I>pmstat</I> - Outputs an ASCII high-level summary of system performance.
    <LI><I>pmie</I> - An inference engine that can evaluate predicate-action rules to perform alarms and automate system management tasks.
    <LI><I>pminfo</I> - Interrogate specific performance metrics and the meta data that describes them.
    <LI><I>pmlogger</I> - Generates PCP archives of performance metrics suitable for replay by most PCP tools.
    <LI><I>pmval</I> - Simple periodic reporting for some or all instances of a performance metric, with optional VCR time control.
</UL>
<P>Additional tools can be found in the layered PCP GUI package.
<UL><LI><I>pmchart</I> - Strip charts for arbitrary combinations of performance metrics.
    <LI><I>pmdumptext</I> - Produce ASCII reports for arbitrary combinations of performance metrics.

where <I>number</I> is an integer or floating point constant (parsed using <B>strtod</B>(3)) and the optional <I>units</I> is one of: seconds, second, secs, sec, s, minutes, minute, mins, min, m, hours, hour, h, days, day and d.  If the <I>unit</I> is empty, second is assumed.</P>
<P>In addition, the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of the above is also acceptable.

</TABLE>
<P>Many PCP tools are designed to operate in some time window of interest, e.g. to define a termination time for real time monitoring or to define a start and end time within a PCP archive log.
<P>In the absence of the <B>-O</B> and <B>-A</B> options to specify an initial sample time origin and time alignment (see above), the PCP application will retrieve the first sample at the start of the time window.
<P>The following options may be used to specify a time window of interest.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#e2e2e2">
	<TR><TD WIDTH="25%"><P><B>-S starttime</B></P></TD>
	    <TD><P>By default the time window commences immediately in real time mode, or coincides with time at the start of the PCP archive log in archive mode.  The <B>-S</B> option may be used to specify a later time for the start of the time window.
<P>The <B>starttime</B> parameter may be given in one of three forms (<B>interval</B> is the same as for the <B>-t</B> option as described above, <B>ctime</B> is described below):
<P><B>interval</B>  To specify an offset from the current time (in real time mode) or the beginning of a PCP archive (in archive mode) simply specify the interval of time as the argument.  For example <I>-S 30min</I> will set the start of the time window to be  exactly 30 minutes from now in real time mode, or exactly 30 minutes from the start of a PCP archive.
<P><B>-interval</B>  To specify an offset from the end of a PCP archive log, prefix the interval argument with a minus sign.  In this case, the start of the time window precedes the time at the end of archive by the given interval.  For example <I>-S -1hour</I> will set the start of the time window to be exactly one hour before the time of the last sample in a PCP archive log.
<P><B>@ctime</B>  To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the start of the time window, use the <B>ctime</B>(3) syntax preceded by an at sign.  For example <I>-S ’@ Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996’</I>. </P></TD></TR>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="25%"><P><B>-T endtime</B></P></TD>
	    <TD><P>By default the end of the time window is unbounded (in real time mode) or aligned with the time at the end of a PCP archive log (in archive mode).  The <B>-T</B> option may be used to specify an earlier time for the end of the time window.
<P>The <B>endtime</B> parameter may be given in one of three forms (interval is the same as for the <B>-t</B> option as described above, <B>ctime</B> is described below):
<P><B>interval</B>  To specify an offset from the start of the time window simply use the interval of time as the argument.  For example <I>-T 2h30m</I> will set the end of the time window to be 2 hours and 30 minutes after the start of the time window.
<P><B>-interval</B>  To specify an offset back from the time at the end of a PCP archive log, prefix the interval argument with a minus sign.  For example <I>-T -90m</I> will set the end of the time window to be 90 minutes before the time of the last sample in a PCP archive log.
<P><B>@ctime</B>  To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the end of the time window, use the <B>ctime</B>(3) syntax preceded by an at sign.  For example <I>-T ’@ Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996’</I>. </P></TD></TR>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="25%"><P><B>-O origin</B></P></TD>
	    <TD><P>By default samples are fetched from the start of the time window (see description of <B>-S</B> option) to the end of the time window (see description of <B>-T</B> option).  The <B>-O</B> option allows the specification of an origin within the time window to be used as the initial sample time.  This is useful for interactive use of a PCP tool with the <B>pmtime</B>(1) VCR replay facility.
<P>The <B>origin</B> argument accepted by <B>-O</B> conforms to the same syntax and semantics as the <B>starttime</B> argument for the <B>-T</B> option.
<P>For example <I>-O -0</I> specifies that the initial position should be at the end of the time window; this is most useful when wishing to replay "backwards" within the time window. </P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>The <B>ctime</B> argument for the <B>-O</B>, <B>-S</B> and <B>-T</B> options is based upon the calendar date and time format of <B>ctime</B>(3), but may be a fully specified time string like <I>Mon Mar  4 13:07:47 1996</I> or a partially specified time like <I>Mar 4 1996</I>, <I>Mar 4</I>, <I>Mar</I>, <I>13:07:50</I> or <I>13:08</I>.
<P>For any missing low order fields, the default value of 0 is assumed for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month and Jan for months.  Hence, the following are equivalent: <I>-S ’@ Mar 1996’</I> and <I>-S ’@ Mar 1 00:00:00 1996’.</I>
<P>If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by starting with the year, month and day from the current time (real time mode) or the time at the beginning of the PCP archive log (archive mode) and advancing the time until it matches the fields that are specified.  So, for example if the time window starts by default at "Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996", then <I>-S @13:10</I> corresponds to 13:10:00 on Mon Mar 4, 1996, while <I>-S @10:00</I> corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue Mar 5, 1996 (note this is the following day).
<P>For greater precision than afforded by <B>ctime</B>(3), the seconds component may be a floating point number.
<P>Also the 12 hour clock (am/pm notation) is supported, so for example <I>13:07</I> and <I>1:07 pm</I> are equivalent.

</TABLE>
<P>The number of performance metric names supported by PCP in IRIX is of the order of a few thousand.  There are fewer metrics on Linux, but still a considerable number.  The PCP libraries and applications use an internal identification scheme that unambiguously associates a single integer with each known performance metric.  This integer is known as the Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID.  Although not a requirement, PMIDs tend to have global consistency across all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has the same PMID.
<P>For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be inappropriate (e.g. this would limit the range of accessible metrics, make the code hard to maintain, force the user interface to be particularly baroque, etc.).  Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is used to provide external names and a hierarchic classification for performance metrics.  A PMNS is represented as a tree, with each node having a label, a pointer to either a PMID (for leaf nodes) or a set of descendent nodes in the PMNS (for non-leaf nodes).
<P>A node label must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by zero or more characters drawn from the alphabetics, the digits and character `_´ (underscore).  For alphabetic characters in a node label, upper and lower case are distinguished.
<P>By convention, the name of a performance metric is constructed by concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS from the root node to a leaf node, with a ‘‘.’’ as a separator.  The root node in the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label associated with one of the descendent nodes below the root node of the PMNS, e.g. <I>kernel.percpu.syscall</I>.  Typically (although this is not a requirement) there would be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS.  For example <I>kernel.all.cpu.idle</I> and <I>disk.dev.read</I> are the unique names for two distinct performance metrics, each with a unique PMID.
<P>Groups of related PMIDs may be named by naming a non-leaf node in the PMNS tree, e.g. <I>disk</I>.
<P>There may be PMIDs with no associated name in a PMNS; this is most likely to occur when specific PMIDs are not available in all systems, e.g. if ORACLE is not installed on a system, there is no good reason to pollute the PMNS with names for all of the ORACLE performance metrics.
<P>Note also that there is no requirement for the PMNS to be the same on all systems, however in practice most applications would be developed against a stable PMNS that was assumed to be a subset of the PMNS on all systems.  Indeed the PCP distribution includes a default local PMNS for just this purpose.
<P>The default local PMNS is located at $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root however the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will then be used as the default local PMNS.
<P>Most applications do not use the local PMNS, but rather import parts of the PMNS as required from the same place that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from <B>pmcd</B>(1) for live monitoring or from a PCP archive for retrospective monitoring.
<P>To explore the PMNS use <B>pminfo</B>(1), or if the PCP GUI package is installed the New Chart and Metric Search windows within <B>pmchart</B>(1).

<P>In configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line options, metric specifications adhere to the following syntax rules.
<P>If the source of performance metrics is real time from <B>pmcd</B>(1) then the accepted syntax is
<P><I>                 host:metric[instance1,instance2,...]</I>

<P>The host:, archive/ and [instance1,instance2,...] components are all optional.
<P>The <B>,</B> delimiter in the list of instance names may be replaced by whitespace.
<P>Special characters in instance names may be escaped by surrounding the name in double quotes or preceding the character with a backslash.
<P>White space is ignored everywhere except within a quoted instance name.
<P>An empty instance is silently ignored, and in particular ‘‘[]’’ is the same as no instance, while ‘‘[one,,,two]’’ is parsed as specifying just the two instances ‘‘one’’ and ‘‘two’’.

</TABLE>
<P>Since PCP version 2, version information has been associated with <B>pmcd</B>(1) and PCP archives.  The version number is used in a number of ways, but most noticeably for the distributed pmns(5).  In PCP version 1, the client applications would load the PMNS from the default PMNS file but in PCP version 2, the client applications extract the PMNS information from <B>pmcd</B> or a PCP archive.  Thus in PCP version 2, the version number is used to determine if the PMNS to use is from the default local file or from the actual current source of the metrics.

	    <TD><P>When attempting to connect to a remote <B>pmcd</B>(1) on a machine that is booting, the connection attempt could potentially block for a long time until the remote machine finishes its initialization.
<P>Most PCP applications and some of the PCP library routines will abort and return an error if the connection has not been established after some specified interval has elapsed.   The  default interval is 5 seconds.  This may be modified by setting <B>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</B> in the environment to a real number of seconds for the desired timeout.  This is most useful in cases where the remote host is at the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to establish the connection correctly.</P></TD></TR>

	    <TD><P>When a monitor or client application loses a connection to a <B>pmcd</B>(1), the connection may be re-established by calling a service routine in the PCP library.  However, attempts to reconnect are controlled by a back-off strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection requests.  By default, the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 seconds for consecutive reconnection requests from a client (the last delay will be repeated for any further attempts after the fifth).  Setting the environment variable <B>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</B> to a comma separated list of positive integers will re-define the back-off delays, e.g. setting <B>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</B> to ‘‘1,2’’ will back-off for 1 second, then attempt another connection request every 2 seconds thereafter.  <P></TD></TR>

<P>The environment variable <B>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</B> may be set to indicate that all such cases of a decreasing <I>counter</I> should be treated as a counter overflow, and hence the values are assumed to have wrapped once in the interval  between consecutive samples.
