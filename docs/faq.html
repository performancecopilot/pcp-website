<h3>What is Performance Co-Pilot?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and performance management.
</p>
<p>
The architecture and services are most attractive for those
seeking centralized monitoring of distributed processing
(e.g. in a cluster or webserver farm environment), or on
large systems with lots of moving parts.  However some of
the features of PCP are also useful for hard performance
problems on smaller system configurations.
</p>

<h3>What is the overall PCP Architecture?</h3>
</p>
<p>
As shown below, performance data is exported from a host by
the PMCD (Performance Metrics Co-ordinating Daemon).  PMCD
sits between monitoring clients and PMDAs (Performance
Metric Domain Agents).  The PMDAs know how to collect
performance data.  PMCD knows how to multiplex messages
between the monitoring clients and the PMDAs.

<h3>What licensing scheme does PCP use?</h3>
</p>
<p>
All of the libraries in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
toolkit are licensed under Version 2.1 of the
<a href='https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html'>GNU Lesser General Public License</a>

<h3>How is PCP different from tools like vmstat, ps, top, etc?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Each of these standard tools:
<ul>
<li>collects a predefined mix of metrics</li>
<li>understands the syntax and semantics of the various &quot;stat&quot; files below &#47;proc</li>
<li>involves no IPC or context switches associated with synchronous IPC</li>
<li>only monitors the local host and cannot monitor a remote host</li>
<li>cannot replay historical data</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Each of these standard tools could also be re-implemented
over the PCP protocols, in which case they would each:
<ul>
<li>collect a predefined mix of metrics</li>
<li>be insulated from how the data is extracted, and have access to the explicit data semantics over the PCP APIs</li>
<li>optionally (and typically) involve IPC and context switches associated with synchronous IPC</li>
<li>monitor the local host or a remote host with equal ease and no application program changes</li>
<li>process real-time or historical data with equal ease and no application program changes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
As examples,
<strong>pmstat</strong>
is a re-implementation of vmstat using the PCP APIs, and similarly
<strong>pmcollectl</strong>
and
<strong>pmatop</strong>
are python versions of the originals.
</p>
<p>
Other new PCP clients could be written to embrace and
extend functionality from existing tools, e.g.
<ul>
<li>
monitor multiple hosts concurrently, e.g. think of top or
vmstat working across all nodes in a cluster; in fact pmstat
can monitor an arbitrary number of hosts concurrently
</li>
<li>
be more general and support display, plotting,
visualization for arbitrary collections of performance
metrics, including those from the service, library and
application layers that are outside any procfs
or other system call export mechanism discover and
exploit extensible collections of performance metrics
as you develop new agents or &quot;plugins&quot;

<h3>Metrics, names, instances and values, ... eh?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Performance Co-Pilot uses a single, comprehensive, data
model to describe all available performance data.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Metric</strong>
<dd>
Information about some activity or resource utilization
or quality of service or tuning parameter or
configuration.
</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
<strong>Metric Value(s)</strong>
<dd>
Each metric may have one value (e.g. the number of CPUs
in the system), or a set of values (e.g. the number of
system calls for each CPU in the system).  The former
are called singular metrics, the latter have an
associated instance domain to describe the set
for which values exist.
</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
<strong>Metric Names</strong>
<dd>
Each metric has an associated name.  The names are
maintained as a hierarchy in a Performance Metrics Name
Space (PMNS) and a &quot;dot&quot; notation is used to
describe a path through the PMNS.  Metrics are
associated with leaf nodes in the PMNS.  For example:
hinv.ncpu, kernel.percpu.syscall, kernel.percpu.cpu.sys
and kernel.all.load.
</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
<strong>Metric Descriptors</strong>
<dd>
Each metric has an associated descriptor that provides
information that may be used to decode and interpret
the values of the metric over time.  The descriptor
provides the following information:
<ul>
<li>
A unique internal Performance Metric Identifier (PMID)
</li>
<li>
The data type for the value(s), being one of 32,
U32, 64, U64, FLOAT, DOUBLE, STRING, AGGREGATE.
</li>
<li>
The identifier for the associated instance domain
for set-valued metrics, else PM_INDOM_NULL for
singular metrics.
</li>
<li>
The semantics of the value(s), i.e. counter,
instantaneous, discrete.
</li>
<li>
The units of the value(s), expressed as a dimension
and scale in the axes time, space and events.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
<strong>Instance Domain</strong>
<dd>
When a metric has a set of associated values, each
value belongs to an instance of an instance domain.
For example the metric kernel.percpu.syscall has one
value for each CPU (or instance) and the instance
domain describes how many CPUs there are and how they
are distinguished from one anoter (i.e. their names).
Each instance domain is described by the following
information:
<ul>
<li>
A unique internal instance domain number (used in
the metric descriptors to associate one or more
metrics with each instance domain).
</li>
<li>
A list of unique external names for each instance.
</li>
<li>
A list of unique internal identifiers for each
instance (the protocols prefer to move 32-bit
instance numbers rather than ASCII instance names).
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dt>
</dl>
<p>
Putting this altogether we can use pminfo to explore
the available information.

<h3>Where is the Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) documented?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The PMAPI defines the interface between a client
application requesting performance data and the collection
infrastructure that delivers the performance data.
</p>
<p>
There are &quot;man&quot; pages for every routine defined
at the PMAPI. Start with &quot;man 3 pmapi&quot; for an
overview. See also Chapter 3 of the:

<h3>Which application development languages are supported?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Most agents and clients are written in C.  Some clients are
C++, and others are written in Python.  There are several
Perl and Python agents, but C remains the most common at
this stage.  Application instrumentation is supported using
the PCP MMV (memory-mapped-value) API.  This is a C library
with Perl and Python bindings.  A pure-Java implementation
exists as well - refer to the separate &quot;Parfait&quot;
project.

<h3>Why the name "Co-Pilot"?</h3>
</p>
<p>
PCP was designed to assist in reducing difficult
performance problems into something that can be managed by
a human.  In the same way that modern aircraft have tightly
integrated computer control systems that a pilot cannot fly
without, PCP assists in managing and understanding
otherwise impossibly complex performance scenarios.

<h3>Why the name "Glider"?</h3>
</p>
<p>
PCP
<a href='glider.html'>Glider</a>
contains the native Windows version of PCP. The rationale
for the name is along these lines:
<ul>
<li>
It's not "just" PCP, so its not just called "Windows
PCP".  It includes a relatively complete,
cross-platform performance management environment for
Windows - PCP and PCP GUI are components, but there are
many other pieces (including C compiler, and Qt4
runtime)
</li>
<li>
"Glider" continues the "Co-Pilot" aeronautical theme,
and is meant to represent "making something difficult
appear effortless".

<h3>What is the nature of the communication between processes?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The TCP/IP communication between PMCD and a monitoring
client is connection-oriented for the most part.
</p>
<p>
The when a connection is lost, the client library will
automatically attempt reconnection to the PMCD with a
controlled maximal rate of trying (uses a variant of
exponential back-off).  The error-handling regime for the
clients already supports &quot;no data currently
available&quot; for lots of reasons (like a PMDA is not
installed or PMCD was restarted or lost the connection to
PMCD), so there is typically very little that the client
developer needs to do to handle this gracefully.
</p>
<p>
For monitor clients, once the initial metadata exchanges
with PMCD are complete, there is typically one message to
PMCD and one message back from PMCD for each sample,
independent of the number of metrics requested and the
number of instances (or values) to be returned.
</p>
<p>
<strong>pmlogger</strong>
is a monitor client, so the same applies to communication
between PMCD and
<strong>pmlogger</strong>
</p>
<p>
At PMCD, each message from a monitor client is forwarded to
one or more PMDAs, PMCD then collates the messages back
from each PMDA that was asked to help and returns a single
message to the client.  It is an important part of the
design that:
<ul>
<li>
clients are ignorant of the de-multiplexing and
multiplexing by PMCD
</li>
<li>
PMDAs are ignorant of each other
</li>
<li>
PMCD knows nothing, except how to act as a message switcher
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The communication between PMCD and the PMDAs uses TCP/IP or
pipes or direct procedure calls (for DSO PMDAs).

<h3>What is involved in fetching metrics from PMCD?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The following high-level description follows the
interactions between a monitoring client and PMCD to fetch
metrics periodically.
<ol>
<li>
The monitoring client connects to PMCD and explores the
Performance Metrics Name Space using
<a href='/man/man3/pmgetchildren.3.html'>pmGetChildren(3)</a>
or pmTraversePMNS(3) for
either one-level at a time expansion or recursive
expansion.
</li>
<li>
Once the client has the name(s) of the metrics of
interest,
<a href='/man/man3/pmlookupname.3.html'>pmLookupName(3)</a>
returns PMIDs and then
<a href='/man/man3/pmlookupdesc.3.html'>pmLookupDesc(3)</a>
will return the descriptor for a metric.
</li>
<li>
For set-valued metrics, use the instance domain number
from the metric descriptor, and the routines
<a href='/man/man3/pmlookupindom.3.html'>pmLookupInDom(3)</a>
<a href='/man/man3/pmgetindom.3.html'>pmGetInDom(3)</a>
and
<a href='/man/man3/pmnameindom.3.html'>pmNameInDom(3)</a>
to browse the instance domain.
Alternatively, ignore the instance domain and all
instances will be returned.
</li>
<li>
See also
<a href='/man/man3/pmlookuptext.3.html'>pmLookupText(3)</a>
and
<a href='/man/man3/pmlookupindomtext.3.html'>pmLookupIndomText(3)</a>
for help text about metrics and instances (better
suited for human consumption than interpretation by
monitoring clients).
</li>
<li>
Repeat until bored:
<a href='/man/man3/pmfetch.3.html'>pmFetch(3)</a>
; report; sleep;
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
To see all of the gory details, turn on PDU tracing and run
simple pminfo commands:
<pre>$ pminfo -D PDU kernel.all.cpu&#x000A;$ pminfo -D PDU -fdT kernel.all.load&#x000A;</pre>

<h3>Data aggregation and averaging in a PMDA?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Mark D. Anderson asks: obviously a monitor can compute
anything it likes, but can a monitor request that a agent
do some server-side computation before sending the
resulting data back, either across measurements (say,
changing units or adding together), or across time (running
average, etc.)?
</p>
<p>
This is certainly possible, but we've tended to discourage
it.  Philosophically we believe any interval-based
aggregation belongs in the monitoring clients.  The PMDA
cannot see the client state, so the PMDA does not know
which client it is responding to at the moment, so you'd
need to add some additional state using the
<a href='/man/man3/pmstore.3.html'>pmStore(3)</a>
interface to selectively modify state in the PMDA from a
client (this is typically used to toggle debug flags or
enable optional instrumentation and changing units would be
in this category).

<h3>Can a monitor ask for qualitative events (e.g. threshold passing), instead of regular samples?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Not directly.  Use the Performance Metrics API (PMAPI)
directly for periodic sampling (most of the PCP monitoring
tools are like this).  Use
<strong>pmie</strong>
for filtering and events. See also
<a href='#Q14'>Synchronous versus asynchronous notification</a>

<h3>How are triggers and alarms integrated to provide external notification?</h3>
</p>
<p>
External notification usually means some combination of
e-mail, paging, phone-home or posting to an event
clearinghouse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>pmie</strong>
is the PCP tool for automated monitoring and taking
predicated actions. pmie's actions are arbitrary;
there are some canned ones, but then there is a general
&quot;execute this command&quot; action.  The latter has
been used to do pager events, and integrate events into
larger system management frameworks like Nagios, OpenView,
and so on.

<h3>Synchronous versus asynchronous notification?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The model for shipping values of the performance metrics
from PMCD to the monitoring clients is &quot;synchronous
pull&quot; where the clients explicitly ask for data when
they want it.  There is no push, broadcast, callback or
other asynchronous notification for the values of
performance metrics, although
<strong>pmie</strong>
can be used to perform period sampling and raise
asynchronous alarms (of any flavour) when something
interesting happens.

<p>
<a name='Q15'></a>
<h3>Do you try to synchronize clocks?</h3>
</p>
<p>
No.  The clients receive one timestamp from PMCD with each
group of values returned, so the only issue is skew when a
monitoring client is processing performance data from more
than one host or more than one archive.
</p>
<p>
This is not a real problem in most cases because PCP is
aiming at system-level performance monitoring, with a bias
for large systems, so sampling rates are typically of the
order of a few seconds up to tens of minutes.  We do not
try to tackle event traces requiring sub-microsecond
accuracy in the timestamps.

<h3>Is there an optimized mechanism for local monitoring?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Yes.  Applications wishing to avoid the overhead of
connection to PMCD and communication over TCP/IP may
extract operating system performance data directly using
the DSO implementation of the PMDA.  The same application
can decide at run-time to use either the regular or the
express access path.

<h3>What about security?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Originally, there was no client or server authentication
and no encryption.  In recent releases, this has been
extended with optional secure connections, which are
encrypted and can also provide user authentication.
</p>
<p>
A simple access control model was used in the past - the
PMCD daemon and the pmlogger processes support an
IP-based allow/disallow mechanism for client connections on
some or all network interfaces.
</p>
<p>
This too has since been extended, allowing for a user based
access control mechanism such that access to the collector
daemons can be restricted based on host(s), user(s) and/or
group(s).

<h3>PMNS appears to be empty!</h3>
</p>
<p>
If you re-build PCP from the source and use &quot;make
install&quot; to do the installation (as opposed to a
package-based installation), some manual post-installation
steps will be required.
</p>
<p>
In particular the &quot;PMNS appears to be empty!&quot;
message from any PCP monitoring tool means the Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS) has not been correctly set up.
To fix this:
<pre># source /etc/pcp.conf&#x000A;# touch $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/.NeedRebuild&#x000A;# $PCP_RC_DIR/pcp start&#x000A;</pre>
else if you are not starting pmcd this way, the
brute-force method is,
<pre># cd $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns&#x000A;# ./Rebuild -du&#x000A;</pre>

<h3>Resource utilization greater than 100%?</h3>
</p>
<p>
Mail received from Nicholas Guillier on Wed, 30 Jun 2004.

I use PCP-2.2.2 to remotely monitor a Linux system.
I sometimes face a strange problem: between two
samples, the consumed CPU time is higher than the
real time!  Once turned into a percentage, the resulting
value can reach up to 250% of CPU load!  This case occurs
for kernel.cpu.* metrics and with disk.all.avactive
metric as well (both from the Linux pmda).
</i>
</p>
<p>
First CPU time and disk active time are both really
counters in units of time in the kernel, so the
reported value for the metric
<i>v</i>
requires observations at times
<i>t</i>
<sub>1</sub>
and
<i>t</i>
<sub>2</sub>
then reporting the rate (actually time/time, so a utilization)
as
<i>(v(t</i>
<sub>2</sub>
<i>) - v(t</i>
<sub>1</sub>
<i>)) / (t</i>
<sub>2</sub>
<i>- t</i>
<sub>1</sub>
<i>)</i>
</p>
<p>
The sort of perturbation you report occurs when the
collector system (PMCD and PMDAs) is heavily loaded.
</p>
<p>
The collection architecture assigns one timestamp per
fetch, and if the collection system is heavily loaded then
there is some (non-trivial in the extreme case) time window
between when the first value in the fetch is retrieved from
the kernel and when the last is retried from the kernel.
</p>
<p>
Let me try to explain with an example with two counter
metrics, x and y with correct values as shown below:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Time (t)
</th>
<th>
x
</th>
<th>
y
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0
</td>
<td>
0
</td>
<td>
0
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
10
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2
</td>
<td>
2
</td>
<td>
20
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3
</td>
<td>
3
</td>
<td>
30
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
40
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5
</td>
<td>
5
</td>
<td>
50
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
6
</td>
<td>
6
</td>
<td>
60
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
70
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
8
</td>
<td>
8
</td>
<td>
80
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Now on a lightly loaded system, if we consider 3 samples at
t=1, t=4 and t=7, and [x] is the timestamp associated with
the returned values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Time
</th>
<th>
Action
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=1 and y=10
<br>
pcp client receives {[1] x=1 y=10}
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=4 and y=40
<br>
pcp client receives {[4] x=4 y=40}
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=7 and y=70
<br>
pcp client receives {[7] x=7 y=70}
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
And the reported rates would be correct, namely:
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Time (t)
</th>
<th>
x
</th>
<th>
y
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
no values available
</td>
<td>
no values available
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
(4-1)/3=1.00
</td>
<td>
(40-10)/3=10.00
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
(7-4)/3=1.00
</td>
<td>
(70-40)/3=10.00
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Now on a heavily loaded system this could happen ...
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Time
</th>
<th>
Action
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=1 and y=10
<br>
pcp client receives {[1] x=1 y=10}
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=4
<br>
..delay..
<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves y=50
<br>
pcp client receives {[5]x=4 y=50}
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
pmcd retrieves x=7 and y=70
<br>
pcp client receives {[7] x=7 y=70}
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
And the reported rates would be ...
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Time (t)
</th>
<th>
x
</th>
<th>
y
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
no values available
</td>
<td>
no values available
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
</td>
<td>
(4-1)/4=0.75
</td>
<td>
(50-10)/4=10.00
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7
</td>
<td>
(7-4)/2=1.50
</td>
<td>
(70-50)/2=10.00
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
So, the delayed fetch at time 4 (which does not return
values until time 5) produces:
<ul>
<li>
x is too small at t=5
</li>
<li>
x is too big at t=7
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You're noticing the second case.
</p>
<p>
Note that because these are counters, the effects are
self-cancelling and diminish over longer sampling
intervals.  There is nothing inherently wrong here.

<h3>PMDA appears to have died</h3>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes errors are returned from a metric value fetch
from pmcd like "No PMCD agent for domain of request".
</p>
<p>
There are a number of possible causes, but one is most
common.  This is the scenario where a PMDA is unable to
respond to a request in a timely fashion, usually due to
unexpected or unusual latency in the source of its values
(the "domain") and not anything related to the PMDA at all.
</p>
<p>
Since pmcd aims to provide realtime metrics at the time of
each sample, it cannot wait for long for the PMDA.  So it
times out the request after a short period (a few seconds
by default), assuming the PMDA is unavailable when no
response is received, and closes its connection to the PMDA.
</p>
<p>
This appears from the client side as if the PMDA died as
no values are available.  Examination of pmcd.log can be
used to confirm when timeouts have occured.
</p>
<p>
As of pcp-3.11.3 there are now two strategies available
to mitigate this by attempting automatic recovery.  In
both cases, pmdaroot must be configured and running (by
default it is) for these strategies to be effective.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, pmcd will attempt one immediate restart of any
PMDA it timed out, at the first available opportunity.
This is quite effective, but there remain several cases
where it can be thwarted.  As it involves a once-only
rectification attempt, a backup strategy is also useful.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, a local primary pmie daemon can be enabled to
continually monitor the PMDAs and signal to pmcd when a
restart is needed.  If a PMDA can be restarted
automatically, eventually this strategy will manage to
do so (unlike the earlier single-shot strategy).  pmie is
not typically enabled by default, however; refer to the
pmie section in the
<a href='/docs/guide.html#pmie'>Quick Reference</a>
which describes how to enable pmie.
</p>
<p>
This latter mechanism also writes to the system log when
a PMDA is detected to have failed, and the log message
contains details about exactly which PMDAs were affected.
