*** Website environment installation/configuration ***

## Manual process for F20

Instructions tested on an uptodate F20 installed with the minimal profile:
1) Install the following packages:
dnf install -y git ruby rubygem-compass rubygem-haml lynx python rsync publican autoconf \
  avahi-devel bison cairo-devel cyrus-sasl-devel desktop-file-utils flex libibmad-devel \
  libibumad-devel libmicrohttpd-devel ncurses-devel nss-devel papi-devel perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker \
  python-devel python3-devel qt-devel readline-devel rpm-devel systemd-devel systemtap-sdt-devel \
  glibc-devel gcc gcc-c++ man2html vim linkchecker python-beautifulsoup4 rubygems python-requests

1.a) Install the following rubygem:
  gem install sass-globbing

2) Clone the following repos:
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/performancecopilot.github.io [PCPWEB]
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp-website.git [PCPWEBSITE]
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp.git [PCP]

  Note: these build instructions assume PCPWEB is up-to-date locally. If not, then you
  should either  cd PCPWEB; git pull  or move the existing tree aside and reclone with:
    git clone git@github.com:performancecopilot/performancecopilot.github.io.git
  Otherwise after running the build in PCPWEBSITE, the make install (i.e. git push) will
  probably fail because upstream has more recent commits than locally.

3) Symlink the pcp-brand:
ln -s [PCPWEBSITE]/pcp-brand /usr/share/publican/Common_Content/

4) Compile the pcp git tree with:
  cd [PCP] && ./configure --with-books --with-books-brand=pcp-brand && cd books && make

This will have created all the books in all the needed formats
using the pcp-brand

5) if doing a new release, edit index.haml and add to the "News" section, using
similar formatting as the previous news/release item. Beware indentation and
tabs - when editing, best to use set sw=4 ts=8 expandtab

6) Create the website:
Adjust the PCPGIT and DSTLOCAL in [PCPWEBSITE]/Makefile or
[PCPWEBSITE]/localdefs then
  cd [PCPWEBSITE] && make

This will create the website content in $DSTLOCAL
Check index.html was built correctly - any syntax errors in index.haml will result
in a zero size top level index.html but the build will still seem to have succeeded.
If all OK, then commit the contents to PCPWEB and git push.

You can run 'make check' to have linkchecker report on all the links, but it
seems it requires the python-requests-2.2.0 package that is present in F21

## Vagrant based site build

With vagrant and virtualbox installed, run:

`vagrant up`

This will build the site in the `generated-pcp-website` directory

rsync the content to webserver
