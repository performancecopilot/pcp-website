*** Website environment installation/configuration ***

## Manual process for F20

Instructions tested on an uptodate F20 installed with the minimal profile:
1) Install the following packages:
dnf install -y git ruby rubygem-compass rubygem-haml lynx python rsync publican autoconf \
  avahi-devel bison cairo-devel cyrus-sasl-devel desktop-file-utils flex libibmad-devel \
  libibumad-devel libmicrohttpd-devel ncurses-devel nss-devel papi-devel perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker \
  python-devel python3-devel qt-devel readline-devel rpm-devel systemd-devel systemtap-sdt-devel \
  glibc-devel gcc gcc-c++ man2html vim linkchecker python-beautifulsoup4 rubygems python-requests

1.a) Install the following rubygem:
  gem install sass-globbing

2) Clone the following repos:
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/performancecopilot.github.io [PCPWEB]
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp-website.git [PCPWEBSITE]
  git clone https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp.git [PCP]

3) Symlink the pcp-brand:
ln -s [PCPWEBSITE]/pcp-brand /usr/share/publican/Common_Content/

4) Compile the pcp git tree with:
  cd [PCP] && ./configure --with-books --with-books-brand=pcp-brand && cd books && make

This will have created all the books in all the needed formats
using the pcp-brand

5) Create the website:
Adjust the PCPGIT and DSTLOCAL in [PCPWEBSITE]/Makefile or
[PCPWEBSITE]/localdefs then
  cd [PCPWEBSITE] && make

This will create the website content in $DSTLOCAL
Commit the contents to PCPWEB and git push.

You can run 'make check' to have linkchecker report on all the links, but it
seems it requires the python-requests-2.2.0 package that is present in F21

## Vagrant based site build

With vagrant and virtualbox installed, run:

`vagrant up`

This will build the site in the `generated-pcp-website` directory

rsync the content to webserver
