Process to make a new PCP release
=================================

Steps to create the packages for a new release
----------------------------------------------
1. Update CHANGELOG with release notes
2. Tag release in git (tagged and signed using pcp-maintainers key)
   Ex: git tag -s -u DEA2C114 -m X.Y.Z X.Y.Z
   Update https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/releases to
   indicate the new version is now the latest (Edit Release ->
   Update Release in the web UI).
3. Packages are uploaded to artifactory via github actions now.
4. For the official Debian source uploads by debian developers
   export DEB_SIGN_KEYID=0xFE0842EE36DD8C0C
   ./Makepkgs --signed --with-python3=yes --with-systemd=yes --with-bcc=no
5. For the official Fedora uploads by sanctioned developers,
   use official spec (as redhat.spec) and build with fedpkg.

Steps to update the webpage for the new release
-----------------------------------------------
1. From the end of index.haml replace the previous last PCP news
   with a short note about the new release (moved to the front).
   Update the website via "make && make install" (see README).
2. Send an email to pcp-announce@groups.io and pcp@groups.io with
   the details of the new release (include the full changelog).
