            %h3 Enhancements for PCP archives
            %p
              One of the key features of PCP is that real-time and historical
              sources of performance metrics are equivalent from the perspective
              of a client application consuming and processing performance data.
              The PCP
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.io/man/man5/LOGARCHIVE.5.html'} archive
              format is the corner-stone of the historical data support.
              This project aims to improve the usefulness and performance of
              PCP archives through a number of independent sub-projects.
              %ul
                %li
                  Over time, we would like to reduce the volume of archived data
                  by increasing the effective sampling interval, e.g. going from
                  sub-minute sampling for the most recent archives to hourly
                  sampling for weekly or monthly archives.
                  This process needs to account for counters that might wrap,
                  counters that might be reset at system or service restarts,
                  small amounts of missing data, etc. while maintaining the
                  semantics of the original data.
                  %a{:href => 'https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmlogreduce.1.html'} pmlogreduce
                  already does some of this, but there are a number of issues
                  that can best be addressed by a complete re-implementation.
                %li
                  There is considerable redundancy in the on-disk metadata that
                  could be reduced by a new incremental format for instance
                  domains.
                %li
                  When an archive is opened, not all the metrics are of interest
                  to a particular applications, so run-time efficiency could be
                  enhanced by lazy (just in time) loading of metadata.
              These projects will require the student to gain a deep
              understanding of the PCP archive format created by
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmlogger'} pmlogger
              and to apply basic statistical concepts to the transformation of
              timeseries data.

            %p
              Performance Co-Pilot is a system performance analysis toolkit which
              currently does not provide an agent for
              %a{:href => 'https://github.com/etsy/statsd'} statsd
              protocol, a text-based UDP protocol for

              aggregation.
              The goal is to design and write a PCP agent as a multi-threaded C
              process performing aggregation of statsd packets as pluggable modules
              with two implementations: exact computation and HDR histogram with
              parsing code as pluggable modules: custom parser or ragel-based parser.

              memory, network, disk, applications (and many more).
              In Grafana, each high level panel can be linked (via a URL) to
              more detailed performance data, and thus offer an
              intuitive drill-down model for rapidly solving common, yet
